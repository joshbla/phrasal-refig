Every time you edit the Twitch folder, you need to re-create the authorization token in config.json and disconnect libsbot from your account.

Paste your client id into:
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<client_id>&redirect_uri=http://localhost&response_type=code&scope=chat:read chat:edit

Run the page

Copy the data from the resulting page's URL. The code is between "code=" and "&"

My current client id:
lo0d1rjsprzb1jci8nasq8h4vlyi89

Disconnect libsbot from the bottom of this page:
